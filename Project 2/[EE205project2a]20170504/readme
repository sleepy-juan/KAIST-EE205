## Implementations
I strictly followed the instructions, comments, and answers uploaded on classum. I implemented two linked lists, one for singly linked list, and the other for doubly linked list.

### Singly Linked List
Singly Linked List has a head pointer to indicate where the head of linked list is. This is the only pointer pointing the element in singly linked list, so the methods iterate all the elements from this head pointer. As instruction pdf mentioned, Head is a pointer of the first real element.

### Doubly Linked List
Doubly Linked List has two head and tail pointers, which are not read elements. So, in case of initial state, head is directly pointing to tail as next, and tail is directly pointing to head as prev. Instead of head and tail, front and back indicates first and last real elements.
